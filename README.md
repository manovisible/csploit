# CSploit
CSploit is an external CS 1.6 cheat.

## Combat Functions
### Infinite Ammo
Gives your weapon exactly 40 ammo, but it never ends.
### Recoil Assist
Reduces your weapon recoil.

## Movement Functions
Movement Functions are server-sided, so it **DOES NOT** work everytime.
### Step
Gives you infinite step size.
### Low Gravity
Reduces your gravity.
### Fly 
Allows you to fly. To use it, jump and control yourself in the air. WARNING: It inverts your controls, so use **S** to go fowards and **W** to go backwards. This applies to **A** and **D** as well.

## Misc. Functions
### 10K Cash
Increases your amount of cash to 10K. To use it, activate it and kill someone. You should have around 16K.

## Important
Open the game **FIRST**, then run CSploit.exe. When you want to quit, close CSploit **FIRST**, then close the game. If you don't follow this steps correctly, you will get a bunch of Error messages, and the only way to make them stop is by going to the Task Manager and ending the task.
