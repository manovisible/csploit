# CSploit
CSploit is an external CS 1.6 cheat.

## Combat Functions
### Infinite Ammo
Gives your weapon exactly 40 ammo, but it never ends.
### Recoil Assist
Reduces your weapon recoil in over 95%. No recoil (at all!) for close/mid range.

## Misc. Functions
### 10K Cash
Increases your amount of cash to 10K. To use it, activate it and kill someone. You should have around 16K.
### The "sv_cheats" Bypasser
Forces "sv_cheats 1" on any server.
## Important
Open the game **FIRST**, then run CSploit.exe. When you want to quit, close CSploit **FIRST**, then close the game. If you don't follow this steps correctly, you will get a bunch of Error messages, and the only way to make them stop is by going to the Task Manager and ending the task.
